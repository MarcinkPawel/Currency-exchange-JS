Going through the process of calculation is plain easy. Polish currency is set as default, then five different currencies are ready to choose from. Despite the fact that the rates are fixed, a result is shown accurately.
It is a perfect web to tell you how much you can be left with while trying to leave Poland before upcoming economic crisis.
